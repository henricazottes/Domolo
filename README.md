# Domolo
A simple home automation project based on a raspberry pi and some esp8266. 
I start everything from scratch so it might not be the perfect solution :p

#Modules

I'd like to developp different modules such as:
  - temperature             ✘
  - movement detection      ✘
  - relay                   ✘
  - IR emitter              ✔
  - Ligth sensor            ✘

#Server

The server part will be embed on a Raspberry pi (model B first version), and should implement the following functions:
  - remote control layout   ✔
  - modules auto detection  ✘
  - dashboard               ✘
